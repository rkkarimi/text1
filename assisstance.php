<p>why is it important to request for extra help or read about it!?</p>
<p>Firstly we are all born with knowing nothing about life by the time we
realise that we learn every day in our daily basis.</p>
<p>Secondly we do not request unless we just notice that we can not do the right thing the way 
it supposed to be or to follow right instruction we need assistance sometimes .</p>
<p>Lastly by getting help from whose who has good ability enusre us that our time goes well and 
do the thing much faster than we expect.</p>
