<b>Who We Are</b>

<p>FlightStats is a cutting-edge data services company focused on commercial 
aviation. We are the leading provider of real-time global flight data to 
companies and individuals across the travel ecosystem. We strive to tell 
the “story” of a flight – from what’s expected, to what is happening now, 
to what happened. We deliver these stories via our Data Services, and through 
our FlightStats-branded web and mobile applications. We believe flight data is 
valuable on its own, but often even more valuable when delivered in conjunction 
with other contextual data. We manage multiple data sets that relate directly to 
flights, and multiple data sets that intersect with flights – trips, weather, 
and much more. We have invested heavily in a data management platform that enables 
us to ingest, process, store and deliver data efficiently and at scale. With our 
capabilities, we are well positioned to be a critical hub in the travel ecosystem 
for years to come.</p>
